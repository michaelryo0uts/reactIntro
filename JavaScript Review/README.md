- Instead of using proxying, you could [CORS in Express](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html). However, note that you should setup the origin in the corsOptions to properly secure your application.
- Alternatively, you could also have your Express application serve the React/Angular project (rather than using the React/Angular development server)
